# Tech-post
A CMS style post page using the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, "Sequelize" as the ORM, and the express-session "npm" package for authentication.

This is still a work in progress, the signup and posts are not working yet, but the login is working and the dashboard is working as well.
